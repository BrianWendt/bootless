# Bootless WordPress Theme

This theme utilizes Twitter [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to provide a
easy to customize solution to front-end developers. Bootless is not intended for
end-user customization, rather it has been developed to provide a starting point
for developers to build custom themes using Bootstrap.

Bootless leverages LESS to provide extensive customization of the Bootstrap
framework. A PHP LESS compiler is included with the theme
